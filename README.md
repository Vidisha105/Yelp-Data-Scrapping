# Yelp-Data-Scrapping
I'll be writing a Python program that searches on yelp.com for the “Donut Shops” in the San Francisco area
 
Then I'll be parses out all shop information and create a MongoDB collection that stores all the 
extracted shop information.
 
Then I'll use Python to write new code that reads the 40 shopand parses each  shop’s address, phone number, and website.
 
Using the site https://positionstack.com/ , we will shop address’ geolocation and update each shop document on the MongoDB collection.
